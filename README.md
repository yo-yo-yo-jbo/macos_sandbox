# Introduction to macOS - the App sandbox
Continuing with my transition to macOS blogpost series, I'd like to discuss a bit about the macOS App sandbox.  
It is highly recommended to read the [macOS App structure](https://github.com/yo-yo-yo-jbo/macos_app_structure) blogpost first - I will be assuming the reader knows the difference between Apps, processes (tasks), know a little bit about `launchd` and its relation to App launching.
